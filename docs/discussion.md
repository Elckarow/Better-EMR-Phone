# Discussion

*probably the longest part of the doc have fun*

## Functions

*The following functions and variables are defined in the* **`phone.discussion`** *namespace.*

`def remove_text_tags(s)`
Formats the `emoji` text tag in `s` according to `phone.emojis.format_emoji_tag` and removes all other text tags.

`def discussion(gc)`
Starts a discussion with the `*group chat*` `gc`. If `None` is passed, the current group chat is used.
The python equivalent of the `phone discussion` statement.

`def end_discussion()`
Ends the current discussion.
The python equivalent of the `phone end discussion` statement.

`def message(sender, message, delay=None)`
Sends a message by the `*character*` sender to the current group chat. Text tags should not be used.
Pauses for `delay` seconds after the message's been saved.
The python equivalent of the default discussion statement.

`def image(sender, image, time=2.0, delay=None)`
Sends an image by the `*character*` sender to the current group chat. `time` is the time the image is being sent for.
The python equivalent of the `image` discussion statement.

`def label(label, delay=0.5)`
Adds a label to the current group chat.
The python equivalent of the `label` discussion statement.

`def date(month, day, year, hour, minute, delay=0.5):`
Adds a date as label to the current group chat. The date is saved to the group chat using `datetime.datetime`. If any of these values are `None`, they are taken from the currently saved date. If any of these values are `True`, they are taken from the date returned by `phone.system.get_date()`.
The python equivalent of the `time` discussion statement.

`def typing(sender, value, delay=None)`
Simulates the `*character*` `sender` typing for `value` seconds. If `value` is a string, `sender.get_typing_delay` is called.
The python equivalent of the `type` discussion statement.

`def choice(captions, delay=0.3)`
Causes a choice to occur inside the phone, and returns the caption that has been chosen. `captions` is a list of strings.
The python equivalent of the `menu` discussion statement.

`def audio(sender, audio, time=2.0, delay=None)`
Sends an audio by the `*character*` sender to the current group chat. `time` is the time the audio is being sent for.

`def register_message(group, sender, text)`
Saves a message sent by the `*character*` `sender` in the `*group chat*` `group`.
This is called automatically by the `phone.discussion.message` function.
The python equivalent of the default register statement.

`def register_image(group, sender, image)`
Saves an image sent by the `*character*` `sender` in the `*group chat*` `group`.
This is called automatically by the `phone.discussion.image` function.
The python equivalent of the `image` register statement.

`def register_label(group, label)`
Saves a label in the `*group chat*` `group`.
This is called automatically by the `phone.discussion.label` function.
The python equivalent of the `label` register statement.

`def register_date(group, month, day, year, hour, minute)`
Saves a date in the `*group chat*` `group`.
This is called automatically by the `phone.discussion.date` function.
The python equivalent of the `time` register statement.

`def register_audio(group, sender, audio)`
Saves an audio sent by the `*character*` `sender` in the `*group chat*` `group`.
This is called automatically by the `phone.discussion.audio` function.
The python equivalent of the `audio` register statement.

`def sort_messages(key)`
Sorts the group chats of the `*character*` `key` in descending order according to their last registered date.

## The statements

The framework comes with its load of custom statements aiming at making it easier to use.

### The discussion statements

`phone discussion`
Used to start a phone discussion.
If a simple expression is given, it must be a `*group chat*`.
If no simple expression is given (or that `None` is given), it's assumed that a discussion is already going on, and will therefore use the current group chat.

If a block is given, the following statements can be used:

- ` `
The default statement, equivalent of the `phone.discussion.message` function.
It expects a `*character*` and a string (flagged as translatable).
It accepts the `delay` property (defaults to `None`) which is the time to wait before the next statement executes. A `None` delay will wait for user input. A negative value delay won't wait.

- `image` 
The equivalent of the `phone.discussion.image` function.
It expects a `*character*` and a simple expression (the image).
It accepts the `time` property (defaults to `2.0`), which is the time the image is being sent for.

- `label`
The equivalent of the `phone.discussion.label` function.
It expects a string (the string is flagged as being translatable).
It also accepts the `delay` property (defaults to `0.5`).
    
- `time`
The equivalent of the `phone.discussion.date` function.
It expects at least one of the following property; `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`; which can be a number, `None` or `True`.
If one of these is missing, it is retrieved from the current date registered.
It also accepts the `delay` property (defaults to 0.5).
    
- `type`
The equivalent of the `phone.discussion.typing` function.
It expects a `*character*` and a `value` property, which can be a number or a string.
The string is NOT flagged as translatable.
It also accepts the `delay` property (defaults to `None`).
    
- `if/elif/else`
Does exactly what you'd expect from this statement.

- `menu`
The equivalent of the `phone.discussion.choice` function.
It expects a block which can contain the following:
The `delay` property, which has to be given before the menu items (defaults to `0.3`).
A series of menuitems. A menuitem is a string (flagged as translatable) which may be followed by an `if` clause and a simple expression. If the expression is false, the choice won't appear. The line ends with a colon `:` and must be followed by a block that contains any of the phone discussion statements.
    
- `$`
The one-line python statement.
Executes code in the global store.
    
- `python`
Works the same way as the normal `python` statement except for one thing:
If the `in` clause is given, the substore is created at init 0, unlike the regular `python` statement which does it at early time.
    
- `pass`
Does nothing and waits for user input. Can be used to display the phone screen without actually sending any message.

If no block is given, it behaves as if a single `pass` statement was given.

`phone end discussion`
Used to end a phone discussion.
It doesn't expect anything.

### The register statements

`phone register`
Used to register messages in a group chat.
It expects a `*group chat*` and a block (see the part above).
It doesn't accept the `type`, `menu`, `$` nor `python` statements, nor the properties related to time (`delay`, `time`, `cps` ...).
If the `pass` statement is used, does nothing.

`init phone register`
Used to register messages in a group chat at init time and / or create a new group chat.
The statement is run at init priority 700.

If a `*group chat*` is given, it behaves the same way as the `phone register` statement.
If no `*group chat*` is given, the block expects a `define` clause.

The `define` clause expects a string, the name of the group chat, and a block which can contain the following statements:
- `add`
Expects a `*character*`. Will add this `*character*` to the group chat when created.
    
- `key`
Expects a simple expression. The key of the group chat.
    
- `icon`
Expects a displayable. The icon of the group chat.
    
- `as`
Expects a dotted name. The group chat will be saved in the global store under this name (as if the group chat was manually created using the `default` statement).

## Example

```
# create two phone Character objects
default phone_sayori = phone.character.Character("Sayori", phone.config.basedir + "sayori_icon.png", "s", 21, "#22Abf8")
default phone_mc = phone.character.Character("MC", phone.config.basedir + "mc_icon.png", "mc", 35, "#484848")

# create a group chat manually
default mc_sayo_gc = phone.group_chat.GroupChat("Sayori", phone.config.basedir + "sayori_icon.png", "mc_sayo").add_character("mc").add_character("s")

# create another group chat using `init phone register`
# and add a few messages
init phone register:
    define "goofy ahh chat":
        icon phone.config.basedir + "sayori_icon.png" key "goofy"
        add "mc" add "s" as goofy
 
    time month 1 day 26 year 2013 hour 14 minute 31
    "mc" "Ah!"
    "s" "Boo!"
    "mc" "Ah!"

label phone_discussion_test:
    scene expression "#fdfdfd"
    phone register mc_sayo_gc:  # using the group chat object directly
        time month 5 day 12 year 2015 hour 20 minute 40
        image "s" Solid("#000", xysize=(50, 50))
        "s" "oops"

    "..."
    "Hmm?"
    "A message from Sayori?"

    phone discussion "mc_sayo": # using the gc's key
        pass
    
    "..."
    "... Really now?"

    phone discussion: # no gc. uses the one used before
        menu:
            "a square?":
                "mc" "a square?"
            "a black square?":
                "mc" "a black square?"
    
    "..."

    phone discussion:
        time minute 50 # year, month, day, hour are all taken from the date before
        "s" "missinput"
    phone end discussion

    "What an airhead..."

    return
```
