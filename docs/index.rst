Welcome to the Better EMR Phone Documentation!
==============================================

**This framework is intended for RenPy 7.4.9+ only. ANy RenPy version below 7.4.9 will lead to errors and unexpected behavior.**

As the name indicates, the first version of this phone was first seen in the DDLC mod `Doki Doki: Exit Music REDUX <https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCMods/comments/q3xamu/edit_music_redux_full_release/>`_.

It was pretty good (visually that is). The back-end code was... *a bit spaghetti not gonna lie*. Since I needed a phone for my own (well not my *own* per se, I simply am the lead coder) DDLC mod `Doki Doki Undercurrents <https://undercurrentsmod.weebly.com/>`_ (go check it out), I decided to... remake the whole thing.
Took a few tries but here we are I guess.

*Credit goes to Wretched Team for the original version.*

**If you are not using this framework for a DDLC mod, the use of Monika's icon, Natsuki's icon, Yuri's icon, Sayori's icon and MC's icon is forbidden.**

**Be sure to credit Elckarow#8399 for making this framework (or I will haunt your dreams).**
