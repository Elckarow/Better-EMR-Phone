System
======

*The following functions and variables are defined in the* **phone.system** *namespace.*

``def get_battery_level()``
    Returns the battery level. If the variable ``battery_level`` is ``None``, the value is taken from the player's device.

``def get_internet_connection_state()``
    Returns the state of the internet connection, represented by the following constants:

    * ``CONNECTED`` wifi is on and connected to the internet
    * ``NO_INTERNET`` wifi is on but no internet connection
    * ``NOT_CONNECTED`` wifi is off
    * ``AIRPLANE_MODE`` airplane mode is on
    * ``CELLULAR_DATA`` wifi is off and cellular data is on

``def get_date()``
    Returns the date. If the variable ``date`` is ``None``, the date used is the player's.

``date = None``
    If not ``None``, a ``datetime.datetime`` object.

``battery_level = None``
    If not ``None``, an integer.

``wifi = None``
    If not ``None``, a boolean.

``locked = False``
    If true, some ``Action``\s (notably in the status bar screen) won't do anything, preventing the player from changing variables when they're not supposed to.

``at_list = []``
    A transform or list of transforms applied to the phone screen (overlay screens excluded). Set back to ``[]`` when exiting the phone.

``cellular_data = False``
    Is cellular data on?

``airplane_mode = False``
    Is airplane mode on?

``bluetooth = False``
    Is bluetooth on?

``internet_connection = True``
    This can be turned on/off for more a realistic gameplay (say the main character is in a very rural place, they won't have access to the internet).

Other variables (``flashlight``, ``rotation_locked``, ``dark_mode``) currently don't have any use and should not be used by creators.
